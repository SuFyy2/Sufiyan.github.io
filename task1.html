        <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits around Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth's diameter, having a sidereal period of 27.3 days and a synodic period of 29.5 days. The Moon faces Earth always with its near side by having a rotation period that equals its orbital period, resulting from being tidally locked to Earth.</p>
